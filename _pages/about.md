# Welcome!

I am a PhD candidate in Political Science at Yale University. My research interests lie in the comparative and international political economy of climate change. Through my dissertation I study how the concentration of industrial production shapes the politics and policy of industrial decarbonization in terms of firm lobbying, collaboration on infrastructure projects, as well as the electoral consequences of green investment. Across all three projects, I leverage plant-level data to microfound explanations for firm and individual behavior on these issues. I combine this quantitative data with qualitative data collected during several months of fieldwork at industrial sites in England, France, and Spain.

Prior to graduate school, I worked for several years in Madrid, Spain. I received my B.A. in Political Science and Spanish from the University of California, Santa Barbara in 2017. During my time at Yale, I was also a visiting researcher at the University of Konstanz.
